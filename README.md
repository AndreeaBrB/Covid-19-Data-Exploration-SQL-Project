# Covid-19-Data-Exploration-SQL-Project
This project conducts an in-depth exploration of COVID-19 data using SQL, aiming to uncover trends and insights related to global cases, deaths, infection rates, and vaccination coverage. Key SQL techniques are employed, including joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), temp tables, window functions, and aggregate functions, to analyze the data comprehensively.

The analysis starts with querying the data to understand basic metrics such as total cases, deaths, and their relationships with population size. It then dives deeper into the likelihood of death upon contracting COVID-19 and the percentage of the population infected across different countries.

Further analysis includes identifying countries and continents with the highest infection and death rates, calculating vaccination rates, and comparing them with total population data. Temporary tables and views are created to manage complex calculations, ensuring data is prepped for subsequent visualizations. This project showcases the power of SQL in managing and analyzing large datasets to derive meaningful insights.
